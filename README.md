# Travel Journal

A simple single page microblog detailing some vacation travel destinations with a picture (from unsplash) and a Google Maps link. Recreated based on [a Figma reference file](https://www.figma.com/file/QG4cOExkdbIbhSfWJhs2gs/Travel-Journal?node-id=0%3A1&t=rHcnGEdv2SED8QPc-0).

I'm still figuring out how to leverage Vite, Yarn, and build tools like Eslint and Prettier, but this only took 2 days of fumbling around to get set up and built.

## Play with it Yourself

It should be as simple as cloning the repo then installing the dependencies.

1. Cloning
   First navigate to the directory where you want to set up the project, then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xEddie/react-travel-journal
```

2. Installing dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Running a local server for development

```bash
yarn run dev
```
